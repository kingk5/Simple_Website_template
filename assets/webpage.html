			<h3>JAPAN! HUB OF ANIME!!</h3>
			<h4>Akhihabara!The City of Anime</h4>
			<img src="aaki.JPG" width=100%>
			<p>Anime and manga have become a global phenomenon in recent years, with the likes of One Piece, Death Note, and Attack on Titan becoming smash hits everywhere from Italy to San Francisco. This would come as no surprise to the Japanese because the manga has been the most popular national pastime in Nippon for countless years, with titanic franchises and industries being built upon the initial black and white pages of weekly or monthly manga.</p>
			<p>If you’re a fan, then a pilgrimage to the fabled anime mecca of Akihabara is certainly going to make your bucket list. Akihabara is a district of Tokyo known locally as “Electric Town”. While the focus is on anime and manga-related merchandise, there are also mountains of electrical goods and components to be rifled through. In fact, there’s so much swag that it often spills out onto the footpaths and streets of Akihabara!</p>
